# Guidelines
This project uses quantitative techniques to price the upfront of a structured bond, followed by an in-depth analysis of risks associated with the Greeks when holding the certificate. Additionally, it explores hedging strategies using simpler instruments such as swaps and caps. You can find the problem statement [here](https://github.com/alehowe/Pricing-and-Hedging/blob/main/Problem_statement.pdf). A detailed description of the methodologies employed is available in the [report](https://github.com/alehowe/Pricing-and-Hedging/blob/main/Report_pricing_and_hedging.pdf). 
To run the project, please refer to this [file](https://github.com/alehowe/Pricing-and-Hedging/blob/main/run_Pricing_and_Hedging.m).
